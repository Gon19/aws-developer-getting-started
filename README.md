## Code used to complete the AWS Developer: Getting Started

The scope of the course is to know more about AWS, by creating an infrastructure in AWS. It was built on AW services like:
- IAM
- CloudWatch
- EC2
- VPC
- DynamoDB
- RDS (PostgreSQL)
- Elastic Beanstalk
- Cloud Formation
- Cloud Front
- ElastiCache

The code is not ready to be used: you need to fix the connection to DB, S3 (and S3 paths to images) and fix the CloudFormation template according to your AWS setup.

For more info check out the [original repository](https://github.com/ryanmurakami/pizza-luvrs) and also check the 
[AWS Developer: Getting Started course on Pluralsight.com](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-developer-getting-started). 

I highly recommend this course if you are getting started (like me on) the AWS world!
